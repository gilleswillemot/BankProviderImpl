# BankProviderImpl

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/gilleswillemot/BankProviderImpl.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#gilleswillemot/BankProviderImpl)

This Kotlin multiplatform library contains a module, created via Android Studio, which has a dependency on com.github.gilleswillemot:bankApp-core
as it implements the IBankProvider interface.

Using kotlin-multiplatform we build different targets (jvm, js, ios, android) in order to share this module over different
web and native applications.
